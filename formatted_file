This the best game of ubisoft ever I love it because of its incredible story, gameplay, free roam etc best game in the worldI am sure that this going to be liked by every one because it is the best part of the franchise @000$
Ubisoft's main attraction is that it puts games into historical moments. In this case, Ezio Auditore the Firenze, the protagonist of this game was able to travel through several Italian Renaissance cities, and each of the cities were as big as the cities back then, and had great detail. I don't think any other studio would make a game that takes place in the Renaissance. Most studios would just repeat the war FPS's. This game is unique, and is undoubtedly one of the best games of all time. @000$
Nothing, I mean no game beats te story of Assassins Creed 2. The gameplay is also one of the best and it became better through Brotherhood and Revelations. Only a true Assassin Creed fan would appreciate this. Undoubtedly the best Ubisoft game till date and among the best sandbox games ever made. @000$
This is the best game ever! @000$
The most adventurous game I have ever played! I loved it very very much! @000$
Dafuq?!? It should be on top 5!1) AC 32) FC 33) AC Revelations4) Future Soldier5) Forgotten SandsAnd on...Then even Watch Dogs is coming out so every game I listed will shift 1 rank downSeriously guys, work on your ratings! @000$

Great Game better than Assassin's Creed @000$
Great game, it is huge game with a huge map and tons of things to do and find. The world is so beautiful full of tropical islands. Countless treasure maps. Endless conflict with ships hunting animals sharks and giant Wales in a size of the ship. A plenty of upgrades on the ship makes it better and better. The story keeps you thinking. It is a catchy story with pirates that make it always wonder what will happen next @000$

Best video game ever played @000$
In 1986, five brothers began the French Revolution of video games, establishing a small development studio in the West of France. A series of fortunate events followed and before you knew it, Ubisoft was selling their wares across the globe and had studios set up in Shanghai, Montreal, and Germany. It's been gravy (and Rayman-sized cheese) ever since. Now, with 25 years under their belt, Ubisoft has become one of the top studios in the world, publishing hundreds and hundreds of games in the process. We enlisted our blindfold and darts resident listmakers to sift through their decades of work and put together the 10 uberest Ubisoft titles ever made. L'enveloppe, s'il vous pla√Æt! @001$
